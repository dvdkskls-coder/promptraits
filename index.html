      prompt: `using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing, no enhancement of skin or hair texture, no added detail, no beauty filters. A cinematic black-and-white portrait taken outdoors at night. The subject stands upright and composed, wearing a long dark wool coat over a plain dark crewneck shirt. He gazes calmly toward the lower horizon with a serious, thoughtful, and quietly pleasant expression — introspective without appearing sad or angry. A large full moon glows softly in the top left quadrant of the frame, providing depth and atmosphere in the background. The lighting is moody and low-key, with soft directional side light creating gentle shadows on the face and emphasizing natural texture without exaggeration. Shot with a 150—600mm telephoto lens at 500mm for extreme background compression and shallow depth of field. The image is vertical 4K, ultra-realistic, with high-dynamic-range, editorial-grade tones and precise focus. Facial features must remain unmodified and natural — no textural exaggeration, no artificial detail, no over-processing. If the subject is female, apply elegant, editorial-style makeup to enhance beauty naturally and respectfully, without altering facial structure.`,

      prompt: `Ultra-realistic vertical 9:16 night rooftop portrait. A figure dressed in a perfectly detailed matte-black armored suit with subtle chest seams, leather cape, and a flawless short-ear cowl mask that reveals only the eyes and mouth, using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing. At their side, calmly seated on the parapet edge, is a dog Robin, using the exact markings from the provided dog photo — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing — wearing a tiny green mask, stitched red vest, and satin-like yellow cape. Both capes blow left-to-right in rooftop wind. Behind, a blurred city skyline glows with soft bokeh; at the top-left quadrant a sharp-edged bone-shaped signal beams through haze. Lighting: cinematic low-key with soft key 45° camera-left, gentle fill 1.5 stops under, warm rim from back-right, faint blue ambient haze. Camera: full-frame sensor, 85 mm prime, f/2.0, 1/125 s, ISO 200, WB 5200—5600K, distance ≈1.6 m, eye-level, shallow DoF with both faces sharp. Framing: medium close-up chest-up, 7% headroom, subject centered, dog seated on parapet visible, cape tips intact. Post: neutral-to-cool grade, rich blacks without crushing, natural skin/fur texture, no cartoon, no oversharpening, no beauty filters.`,

      prompt: `Ultra-realistic vertical 9:16 studio portrait on pure black seamless background. Centered composition, horizon perfectly level. A human subject (using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing, preserve natural skin texture) stands in front, shoulders relaxed, torso rotated 10° to the left, with a subtle closed-lip smile and eyes looking directly at camera. Wearing a matte black crew-neck cotton t-shirt with no logos or text. Behind them, the exact dog from the provided selfie — no retouching, preserve natural fur markings — gently hugs from behind with both front paws resting softly on the subject's shoulders. The dog tilts its head 15° to the right, eyes half-closed in a joyful expression, giving a lick on the subject's left cheek with tongue visible about 1.5 cm. The dog's nose and the subject's mouth corner almost touch, distance ~1 cm. Both faces fully visible inside the frame, with ~7% headroom, eyes aligned with the upper third. Lighting setup: large softbox key at 45° camera-left and 20° above, 5600K, exposing skin at ~IRE 60. Soft fill from camera-right at -1.5 EV relative to key. Warm narrow rim (3000—3200K) from back-right, outlining ears and shoulders, clean separation from background. Pure black seamless with no light spill. Clean catchlights in both sets of eyes. Camera: full-frame body, prime 85 mm at ~1.6 m, f/2.0, 1/125 s, ISO 200, WB 5200—5600K. Eye-AF on human's nearest eye, depth of field sharp on both faces. Framing is medium-close portrait, vertical 9:16, centered, no cropping on ears, nose, or tongue, hands excluded. Color: neutral-to-cool palette, teal-toned shadows, warm rim, rich detailed blacks, editorial micro-contrast, subtle grain. Post: HDR dynamic range, natural skin/fur texture, no beauty filters, no smoothing. Ultra-realistic, professional photography, cinematic style.`,

      prompt: `Ultra-realistic A cinematic low-key medium portrait where a dog presses its snout against the subject's ear as if whispering a secret; the dog lifts one front paw to cover its own mouth, emphasizing the secrecy. The subject remains still, facing the camera directly with wide-open eyes and gently raised eyebrows, giving a natural, realistic expression of being stunned or caught by surprise, while fully preserving their exact facial structure. Both are framed against a pure black background. The subject is wearing a plain black short-sleeve shirt, visible from the chest upward. Using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing. The dog must replicate the one attached alongside the prompt, matching its markings, proportions, and realistic fur texture. Lighting rig: a soft key at 45° camera left with a large diffuser, a gentle fill −1.5 stops on the opposite side, and a subtle rim light from behind for edge separation, all balanced at 5200K. Camera: full-frame body, 85 mm lens at ~1.5 m distance, f/2, 1/125 s, ISO 200, white balance 5200K, Rec.709 profile, eye-AF locked on the nearest human eye. Framing: medium portrait (chest upward), vertical orientation, 9:16 aspect ratio, subject slightly off-center. Post: high-dynamic-range, natural skin texture and realistic fur detail, no beauty filters.`,
