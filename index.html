      prompt: `using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing, no enhancement of skin or hair texture, no added detail, no beauty filters. A cinematic black-and-white portrait taken outdoors at night. The subject stands upright and composed, wearing a long dark wool coat over a plain dark crewneck shirt. He gazes calmly toward the lower horizon with a serious, thoughtful, and quietly pleasant expression — introspective without appearing sad or angry. A large full moon glows softly in the top left quadrant of the frame, providing depth and atmosphere in the background. The lighting is moody and low-key, with soft directional side light creating gentle shadows on the face and emphasizing natural texture without exaggeration. Shot with a 150–600mm telephoto lens at 500mm for extreme background compression and shallow depth of field. The image is vertical 4K, ultra-realistic, with high-dynamic-range, editorial-grade tones and precise focus. Facial features must remain unmodified and natural — no textural exaggeration, no artificial detail, no over-processing. If the subject is female, apply elegant, editorial-style makeup to enhance beauty naturally and respectfully, without altering facial structure.`,

      prompt: `Ultra-realistic black-and-white portrait using the exact face from the provided selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing. The subject stands in total darkness, surrounded by a completely black background, wearing a plain black T-shirt that fades smoothly into the void. Head tilted back at a 45-degree angle, eyes gently closed, as if surrendering or receiving something divine. A dramatic, narrow beam of light descends from above, resembling a celestial ray from the heavens, piercing the darkness and illuminating the face with intense clarity. The beam is clearly visible in the top of the frame, slightly diffused but concentrated, casting sharp shadows under the brow, nose, and chin. The symbolism evokes themes of divine intervention, enlightenment, or inner awakening. Shot with a full-frame DSLR and 85mm f/2.2 lens, in vertical 9:16 composition, 4K resolution. No atmospheric effects like fog or smoke. Just pure light and shadow, minimalist and introspective, with strong contrast and realistic facial detail preserved.`,

Add these garments only if missing; never change the subject’s physique. • Background: completely black. • Camera emulation: 85 mm equivalent lens, f/1.8, ISO 100, 1/160 s. • Resolution: at least 3000 × 4500 px at 300 ppi. • Post-processing: convert to monochrome, keep skin texture natural, subtle edge vignetting; do not retouch facial features or body shape. • Output filenames: "Retrato_BN.tiff" (16-bit) and "Retrato_BN.jpg" (quality 10).`,

The subject stands in a confident 3/4 pose, partially enveloped in environmental mist and tunnel reflections. Their figure is softly blended into the background using cinematic light flares, rain particles and neon haze. The tunnel is deeply blurred with bokeh and long-exposure light streaks, featuring colors that match and contrast the car’s original tones. Below, the exact car from the reference image — preserving its shape, color, wheels, and any custom modifications — is placed from a low cinematic angle with headlights on, reflecting on the wet pavement. Character and vehicle are visually unified through fog, lighting and depth to create an immersive, atmospheric scene. Camera: Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.2 lens. Lighting: mixed neon colors inspired by the actual car, with cinematic contrast. Vertical format, 4K resolution, high-dynamic-range, shallow depth of field.
